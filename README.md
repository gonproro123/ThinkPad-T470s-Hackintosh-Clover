# Setup
## BIOS Settings
- The BIOS must be properly configured before installing MacOS.

- In `Security menu`, set the following settings:

+ Memory Protection > Execution Prevention: Enabled
+ Virtualization > Intel VT: Disabled (Can be enabled later)
+ Virtualization > Intel VT-d: Disabled (Can be enabled later)
+ Secure Boot > Secure Boot: Disabled
+ Anti-Theft > Current Setting: Disabled
+ Anti-Theft > Computrace > Current Setting: Disabled
+ In the Startup menu, set the following options:

UEFI/Legacy Boot: UEFI Only
CSM Support: Yes
Now you can go through the install.

## What's next?
- To finish the setup, you need to:
+ Install the latest Clover_EFI_bootloader.
+ Copy `EFI folder from USB` flash drive to `local drive EFI partition` (like you did for the USB drive). It will make the local drive bootable (so you can get rid of the USB drive now)
+ Coppy kexts in `L/E_Kexts` into `L/E`

## You're almost done! Reboot and enjoy macOS on your Thinkpad T470s.
